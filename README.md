This was around the time I first stated using node and express. I was able to create a functitoning website that allows for open communication.

I learned that attention to deail is very important and the small setbacks can turn into big ones. I tried to add a colon in my ejs right after a "req.body". I ended up wastng time on comments that would repost themselves immediately afterward. I was able to debug it, but more ttention could have prevented this.
